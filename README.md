# Refactor-challenge

## Description

I want to make the existing marketing website more accessible that people with disabilities can also access it using assistive technologies. Also making it optimized for search engines.

I learnt refactoring the existing code by using semantic elements and removing unnecessary code and repetitive code elements.
